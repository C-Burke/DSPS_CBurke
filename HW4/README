Homework 4

In this assignment, I posted my inclass lab which was slightly flawed(to the same degree as my partners). I fixed the lab
while my partners started the second part of the assignment. Once I finished the first part, I went to the parts that my
partners skipped. The primary focus was answering the Newtonian part, relating the two equations given. After this I tried to
Help my partners get the data visalization and ingestion sections to work. Jimmy and Allie were able to fly through the
sections leading up to this part, at which point we all worked together and tried to come up with any ideas that would
make it work. We were able to find the minimum, but not the other values. We were unable to get it all working properly. 
This was, of course, disappointing for us and unfortunately made the rest of the assignment impossible.
