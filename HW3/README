In this homework, we all tried to complete what we could individually. Once we had done some work on our own, we got together
and worked as a team for a majoriety of the assignment. I was able to upload a large portion of the Z-test, but did not have all of it 
from class. Allie DeAbrue was able to add a few pieces of code that were bugged and I was able to patch them. jimmy Williams and I then
were able to finish the end of the Z test. The KS test did not go as well. We did not end up finishing as we got stuck on the for loop
part where we were trying to extract our 'gooddates'. Jimmy and Allie made good strides early on the KS test while I finished the Z test. I
Was able to help them out on a few parts of the KS test so we could keep on moving. Unfortunately we couldnt get past that one part.
